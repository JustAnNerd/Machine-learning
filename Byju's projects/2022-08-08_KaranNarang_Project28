**Kempner Function**, applied to a number, will find the smallest integer greater than zero whose factorial is exactly divisible by that number. \n","\n","You can get a clear idea of **Kempner Function** in the below example.\n","\n","**Explanation:**\n","```\n","  1. kempner(6) ➞ 3\n","\n","1! = 1 % 6 > 0\n","2! = 2 % 6 > 0\n","3! = 6 % 6 == 0          # (3! % 6==0) , so the Kempner of 6 is equal to 3. \n","\n","  2. kempner(10) ➞ 5\n","\n","1! = 1 % 10 > 0\n","2! = 2 % 10 > 0\n","3! = 6 % 10 > 0\n","4! = 24 % 10 > 0\n","5! = 120 % 10 === 0      # (5! % 10==0) , so the Kempner of 10 is equal to 5.\n","```\n","\n","**Constraint:**\n","\n","A Kempner Function applied to a prime number will always return the prime number itself.\n","```\n","kempner(2) ➞ 2\n","\n","kempner(5) ➞ 5\n","```\n","Given an integer n, implement a Kempner Function.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4gjDvOhzn6TL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1659992397345,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":143,"user":{"displayName":"Karan","userId":"08865303078637944641"}},"outputId":"82384a5b-3ba0-4bda-b0de-462b2681e70d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["#
